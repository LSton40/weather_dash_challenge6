# Weather Report

## Project Description

The Weather Report App was designed to allow a user to search for the weather conditions in any major world city, providing the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and current weather conditions, as well as a 5-day forecast of high temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions.

The app presently stores up to 5 cities in its search history, allowing the user to return to a recently, previously searched city at a single click. By default, the page loads to the last search result the user entered from their given computer.
